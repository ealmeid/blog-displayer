## ðŸ“– Overview

This is a simple frontend project built with the following technologies:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Chakra-UI](https://chakra-ui.com/)
- [React-Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/)
- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)

I'm following the atomic design methodology. More about this can be found here: https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-1/ and https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/

In order to run the frontend, execute `npm run dev` in the root directory. The frontend will be accessible at http://localhost:3000

## ðŸ§ª Testing

To run tests, follow the instructions below

```bash
# To Run Component Tests
